Nice — here are ready-to-paste prompts you can give a Replit agent (or any image-generation agent) to produce polished website mockups for the incaptcha design. I give two full prompts (one desktop hero mockup, one mobile screenshot), a short/compact prompt for quick runs, recommended generation settings, and a small negative-prompt list to reduce unwanted artefacts.

Full Desktop Prompt (copy & paste)

Create a high-fidelity desktop website hero mockup for a modern developer-facing CAPTCHA service called incaptcha.

Layout & composition:

Desktop browser viewport (centered card-like page) with generous white space and a subtle rounded container shadow. Canvas ratio about 16:10 (e.g., 1440×900).

Top header: left-aligned “incaptcha” logo (simple wordmark), center/top-right nav items: Docs, Pricing, Support, and a prominent Get API Key rounded rectangular button (green).

Hero area left column: large headline: “Protect Your Site from Bots with incaptcha” (use bold, large type). Subhead under it: “Industry-leading CAPTCHA solution for websites and applications.” A primary CTA button Get Started (green, medium-large). A short 2-bullet list under CTA: “Privacy-first” and “AI-powered challenge”.

Middle/section below hero: three horizontal feature cards/icons: Easy Integration (puzzle icon), Low Latency (chart icon), AI-powered (network icon) with short captions.

Quick Start block: a clean code snippet box showing:
<script src="https://incaptcha-net.js"></script>
<div class="incaptcha-widget"></div>
with a small rounded Copy button at the top-right of the code block.

Footer: minimal links (Docs, FAQ, Terms, Privacy) and small social icons.

Visual style: minimal, modern, developer-friendly. Use system/modern sans (Inter or similar), large readable type scale, generous line-height. Color palette: white background, charcoal text (#111), accent green for CTAs (#0FA77A or similar), blue icons for features. Subtle rounded corners and soft drop shadows.

Micro-interaction cues: include subtle button hover elevation and slight inner shadow for code block.

Accessibility and clarity: high contrast text, obvious visual hierarchy, no clutter.

Render details: clean vector-style icons, flat minimal illustrations, crisp antialiased text.


Deliverable: photorealistic UI mockup (not a photograph) — crisp UI screenshot PNG, high resolution, 300 DPI if possible. No watermarks or logos from other brands.

Full Mobile Prompt (copy & paste)

Create a mobile screenshot mockup for the incaptcha landing/quickstart page.

Layout & composition:

Phone portrait aspect ratio (e.g., 1080×2340 or 393×873 for realistic mobile width). Single column stacked layout.

Compact header with small incaptcha wordmark left and a hamburger icon right. Hero stacked: title “Protect Your Site from Bots with incaptcha”, short subtitle, large full-width primary CTA Get Started (green).

Quick Start snippet appears below hero: a full-width code block with the same snippet and a small copy icon overlay on the right.

Feature cards are stacked vertically (icon then label then tiny caption). Footer shows collapsed links and privacy note.

Visual style consistent with desktop (white background, green CTAs, blue feature icons, modern sans).

Render crisp, legible fonts optimized for mobile.


Deliverable: high-quality PNG mobile screenshot, clean UI, no watermarks.

Compact Prompt (one-line quick prompt)

“Generate a high-resolution desktop UI mockup for a developer product called incaptcha: minimal white hero card with large headline ‘Protect Your Site from Bots with incaptcha’, green CTAs, three feature icons (Easy Integration, Low Latency, AI-powered), a code snippet box with a Copy button, header with Docs/Pricing/Support + Get API Key, and a clean footer. Modern sans UI, flat vector icons, high contrast, PNG, no watermark.”

Recommended Generation Settings

Aspect ratio / size:

Desktop: 1440×900 (16:10) or 1920×1080 (if you want full HD).

Mobile: 1080×2340 (portrait) or 393×873 for compact.


Quality / steps: medium-high (if using configurable sampler): steps 40–60, CFG / guidance 7–9.

Seed: optional—set to a fixed seed if you want reproducible results.

Outputs: 1–3 variations so you can pick the best.

Style: “UI mockup / flat vector / crisp text” (prefer UI/graphic style, not photographic).

Negative prompts (to avoid common issues)

No watermarks, no logos from other companies (Microsoft/Google/Apple), no extra text artifacts, no strange faces, no photorealistic textures, avoid blurred or pixelated text, avoid heavy gradients or neon colors, avoid incorrect code characters or unreadable code.

Extra tips for Replit agent

If Replit agent supports layers or multiple passes, first generate the base layout, then generate a second pass to refine typography and the code-block text so the snippet text stays crisp and legible.

Ask for variations titled “desktop-clean”, “desktop-with-widget-preview”, and “mobile-stacked” to get multiple useful screenshots.

If the agent supports direct CSS hints, include: font-family: Inter, system-ui; border-radius: 12px; box-shadow: 0 6px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.06);

If you want, I can:

produce a slightly shorter prompt for one-click paste into Replit,

or tweak colors, brand name style (lowercase wordmark vs logomark), or produce three alternative headline options to test in the mockups.


Which of those would you like next?
